# MIRAGE Guideline Builder
MIRAGE Guideline Builder

With this project, we are aiming at creating a user guide through the many MIRAGE guidelines. The issue with some of the guidelines is that they are very long and not very userfriendly. 
Thus, a tool would be helpful that assists users/researchers in identifying only those parts of the guidelines that are relevant for the reporting of the corresponding data.
Here, we start with the MIRAGE Reporting Guidelines for Mass Spectrometry Analysis.
